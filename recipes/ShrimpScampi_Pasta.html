          Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook linguine in boiling

          Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large
          skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallots, garlic, and red
          pepper flakes in the hot butter and oil until shallots are
          translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Season shrimp with kosher salt and black
          pepper; add to the skillet and cook until pink, stirring occasionally,
          2 to 3 minutes. Remove shrimp from skillet and keep warm.

          Pour white wine and lemon juice into skillet and bring to a boil while
          scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet
          with a wooden spoon. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet, stir 2
          tablespoons olive oil into butter mixture, and bring to a simmer. Toss
          linguine, shrimp, and parsley in the butter mixture until coated;
          season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil
          to serve.
