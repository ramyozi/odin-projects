      <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>1 pound andouille sausage, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
      <li>5 slices bacon</li>
      <li>1 medium green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Bring water and 2 teaspoons salt to a boil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Whisk grits into the boiling water, and then whisk in half-and-half. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until grits are thickened and tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside and keep warm.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Season shrimp with salt and cayenne pepper. Add lemon juice, toss to combine, and set aside to marinate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Place sausage slices in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove sausage from the skillet.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add bacon to the same skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain, then chop or crumble when cool enough to handle. Leave bacon drippings in the skillet.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add bell peppers, onion, and garlic to the bacon drippings; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 8 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stir cooked sausage and marinated shrimp into the skillet with the cooked vegetables. Turn off the heat and set aside.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour, stirring to create a smooth roux. Turn heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is golden brown in color, 8 to 10 minutes. Watch carefully, mixture burns easily.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pour the roux over the sausage, shrimp, and vegetables.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Place the skillet over medium heat, add chicken broth, bacon, and Worcestershire sauce, and stir to combine. Cook until sauce thickens up and shrimp turn opaque and bright pink, about 8 minutes.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Just before serving, mix Cheddar cheese into grits; stir until cheese is melted and grits are creamy and light yellow.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Spoon grits onto plates and serve shrimp mixture over top.        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
